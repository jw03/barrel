# Getting Started With Barrel

## Prerequisites
A few things to be fully operational and work with our team:

 * We deliver fully-annotated _Design Specifications_ for Development using Invision Freehand/Inspect. [Read this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIMcDQxCApJslQ8CvgxTj4hKfFonwbzzJfVtp6j4gqM/edit?usp=sharing).
 * Supporting design files, including webfonts, often come in other formats such as those from the Adobe Creative Suite or as a public [InvisionApp](https://www.invisionapp.com/) share link. 
 * We require high visibility into the development process. Code **must** be reviewed daily on [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) either with an existing WIP or completed merge request. [Create an account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) and join our group and/or project.
 * For many of our projects, _Functional Specifications_ are created up in [JIRA](https://barrel.atlassian.net) where executional directives, bug reports, preparation tasks, and questions may be found and/or issued. Alternatively, we may use GitLab's Issues and Boards to do the same.
 * Review our living [Best Practices](https://github.com/barrel/barrel-dev-best-practices) for Development documentation. Submit an issue or a merge request, if you have anything to contribute.
 * If you think you are missing something, then ask.
